1. Font Style
Use professional and legible fonts that are easy to read. Common examples:
Sans-serif fonts: Arial, Helvetica, Calibri, Verdana.
Serif fonts: Times New Roman, Georgia, Garamond, Cambria.
Modern professional fonts: Roboto, Open Sans, Lato.
Avoid overly decorative or casual fonts like Comic Sans or Papyrus.
Stick to a single font or use a maximum of two (e.g., one for headings and another for body text).
2. Font Size
Body text: Use a size between 10-12 points to ensure readability.
Headings (e.g., Name, Section Titles): Use a larger size, typically 14-16 points for section headings and 18-24 points for your name.
Avoid font sizes smaller than 10 points unless it’s for very dense sections like references or footnotes.
3. Formatting Criteria
Line Spacing: Maintain a line spacing of 1.0 to 1.15 for a clean, uncluttered look.
Margins: Use standard margins (1 inch on all sides). You can reduce it to 0.5-0.7 inches for fitting more content.
Consistency: Ensure consistent font styles, sizes, and spacing across the resume.
Bold/Italics: Use bold for headings and italics sparingly for emphasis (e.g., job titles, project names).
4. General Design Principles
White Space: Maintain adequate white space to avoid overwhelming the reader.
Alignment: Use left alignment for text, as it’s easier to read.
Bullet Points: Use bullets for lists of responsibilities or achievements. Ensure they are aligned properly.
Color: Stick to black text on a white background for a professional appearance. A subtle color for headings is acceptable but not necessary.
5. Additional Tips
Use a standard format such as PDF to ensure the font style and size remain intact across devices.
If applying for creative roles, you can experiment with slightly unique fonts or layouts, but prioritize readability.
By following these criteria, you can create a polished and professional resume that effectively highlights your skills and experience.
